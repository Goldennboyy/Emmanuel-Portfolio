          Hello, my name is Emmanuel, and I am 22 years old. Always being
          curious about computers & technology during my early age, I turned to
          study in computer science to get my bachelor&apos;s degree in computer
          science management in 2023 at HE2B-ESI. Since then, I have been
          training to expand my knowledge as much as possible to learn even
          more!{" "}
