          Hello, my name is Emmanuel born in ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª with Nigerian heritage ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬. I am
          22 years old. Always being curious about computers & technology during
          my early age, I turned to study in computer science to get my
          bachelor&apos;s degree in computer science management in 2023 at
          HE2B-ESI. Since then, I have been training to expand my knowledge as
          much as possible to learn even more !{" "}
